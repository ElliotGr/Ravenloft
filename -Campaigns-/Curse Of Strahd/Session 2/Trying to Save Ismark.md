Now we're out we can see the writhing form is a pale figure with tattered clothes. It's definitely humanoid. Can hear scuffling from a second direction as well as the creature we can see.

We step out further and it gets even darker. We see a figure fall into view, obscured by the corner of the house. It's the well-built figure and dark clothes of [[Ismark Kolyana]]. He gets dragged out of view.

We head towards where he got dragged to. We cross the square to the house where he is. He's backing away from the figure that was dragging him. There's a second figure which was scratching the house that's now following him too.

He's essentially backing towards another creature.

## Fite Time

[[Martel]] comes out swinging with his fire spirit Elk which is disappointingly not sexy.

[[Ismark Kolyana]] gets bit.

An arrow flies out from the tavern from a mysterious figure and kills a zombie I've been trying to kill with [[Gh'yia Mx-haye-sxonne|Guy]].

The hooded figure kills the final zombie too.

## Post Fite

[[Ismark Kolyana|Ismark]] is still alive and we manage to try to patch him up. [[Artemis Lee|Artemis]] does cure wounds and start to try to patch him up with mundane equipment.

The [[Dukane]] drops ominously from the roof of a nearby building. Blocks the tavern doors.

[[Ismark Kolyana|Ismark]] comes back to consciousness. I bring him back the [[Dukane]] and the rest of the [[Strahd Friends]].

[[Dukane]] tries to persuade [[Ismark Kolyana|Ismark]] that he's good. He seems to manage to persuade him.
