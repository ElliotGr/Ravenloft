[[Ismark Kolyana]] is *pissed*. We have another round. Probably getting to midday. [[Arrick]] is being a creep. Nobody, not even [[Strahd]] remembers a time before [[Strahd]]. I ask [[Ismark Kolyana]] about what will happen to the people of [[Barovia]] but he seems uncertain.

I don't really understand how a body could exist without a soul, but have never seen the practical concerns about it. I'm not sure what would happen to the people without souls. He wants us to find him in his house, the [[Burgomaster House]]. He goes left out the door.

As he leaves, the three [[Vestani]], who are talking another language, watch him as he leaves. They go the opposite direction to [[Ismark Kolyana]].

It starts to get cold. We decide to follow him back to his place. [[Ismark Kolyana]] puts some money on the table and we take it (it was meant to pay [[Arrick]], but [[Gh'yia Mx-haye-sxonne|Guy]] did some 'busniess').

## Shit Gets Fucky

There's some breeze and things get weird… [[Martel]] uses create bonfire to relight the fire in the hearth. As we go to leave the tavern, I cast light on myself. [[Arrick]] has disappeared into a room behind the bar and barricades the door. He has been watching us, I think he's pissed we've tried to leave without paying. Very rapid and sudden movement.

The fog has really rolled in now. We hear a loud scream of a male voice. Sound of pain/distress. Prolonged sound. We decide not to go help. Can hear the sounds of scratching. Like something sharp scratching against wood. Werewolves?

[[Rolando|Rolo]] runs to the inner door, opposite to front door. It's locked. There are more screams. They sound more distant now. Looking out through the glass to try and see what's outside, if anything? Across the street, against one of the buildings, maybe 30ft away. A writhing form, too dark to really see what it is. This is where the scratching noise is from? This isn't where the screaming is coming from, that's elsewhere.

Another set of screams, female this time and bloodcurdling. Can hear something being dragged or muffled. We hear Ismark again, definitely him. We try to do pass without trace to get close to him.
