[[Madam Eva]] time, for real, not the fake [[Marko Romenzo|Marco]]. The crystal ball has divination magic on it.

Apparently she's a guide, only points us in the right direction. Only gives vague hints and directions, but not specifics.

Try to insight about whether she knows where a cure for [[Doru]] would be - she's unreadable.

She picks up an unmarked deck of cards - old AF. Time for a tarot reading!!!

## Tarot Reading

### History Knowledge - An Ancient Act that Will Help Us Understand Our Enemy.

> Swashbuckler, The one of coins
> I see the skeleton of a dead warrior lying on a bed of stone flanked by gargoyles.

### Powerful Force for Good and of Protection - A Holy Symbol of Great Hope

> The Avenger, The one of swords
> This treasure lies in a dragon's house in the hands once of someone clean and now corrupted.

[[Doru]]

[[BIldrath]]?

[[Church of the Morning Lord|Morning Lord]]?? Nah, not generally depicted as a dragon.

### This Card Has Great Power and Strength - Tells of a Weapon of Vengeance

> The Evoker, Six of Stars
> The search, we are looking for the crypt of a wizard extraordinaire, his staff is the key to our salvation.

### This Card Sheds light on the One Who Will Help Us in the Battle against the Darkness

> The Dungeon
> We search for a troubled young man surrounded by wealth and madness. His home is his prison.

[[Ismark Kolyana|Ismark]]

### This Card Sheds light on the One Who is a Creature of Darkness - Will Lead Us to Him, His Powers Are beyond Mortality

> The Executioner
> See a dark figure on a balcony looking down on this tortured land with a twisted smile.

The crystal ball fades to a normal appearance and she settles down to a hunched form.

To complete our journey will require very special individuals.

## [[Marko Romenzo|Marco]], [[Rolando|Rolo]]

Hears the sound of panting - sees an elven figure struggling to get through the forest. [[Rolando|Rolo]], our boy! He tries to message us by slowly spinning around and casting message a whole bunch. It doesn't work?

We all exit and are blinded by the brighter outside light.

## Leaving the place

We hear someone talking from by the fire - [[Jathar]] a large male Vestani with long, wavy hair tied together. Ruddy complexion. Regaling the others with a tale of magic and wonder.

> Once upon a time a might wizard came to this land over a year ago. Stood where you stood. Tried to make a revolt but when they got to the castle, the peasant army
> The precipice overlooking the Iblis
> Rocks fell on the wizard
> Survived
> Lightning struck
> Survived
> Strahd just stabbed him
> Died lol
> Thrown 1000ft to his death
> Climbed down to the river Iblis to see if he was there
> He wasn't there

### [[Alwyn]] Makes Friends with the [[Vestani]]

Another one about the wizard! He did in fact see this occur a year ago. [[Kolyana Indirovich|Burgomaster]] was involved in the fight as well. Seems a powerful wizard, he felt the lightning . Plenty of mages in this land - druids deep to the West in the forests. Some druids in the mountians near mount Ghakis. Mad wizard around lake Zarowich???

## [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] Is Pissed with Us Lmao

Sends [[Marko Romenzo|Marko]] to go fetch us because [[Rolo]] failed.

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] makes some strange comments - I think she's ex-[[Vestani]] lmao. Actually maybe not lol. [[Marko Romenzo|Marko]] knows [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and about the assault on [[Castle Ravenloft]]. [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] doesn't love that the [[Vestani]] didn't do anything during the assault.

## Around the Fire

### Mickey 1vs1

Talks to a druid boy about the [[The First Folk]].

> Order is often a byword for oppression
> \- [[Martel]]

Within the [[Vestani]], the attitudes vary with regards to their relationship with [[Strahd]].

### Ethan 1vs1

Tries to get some info about the tarot card stories. When's the last time you saw a dragon.

One saw a large, dark shadow on the horizon. Pretty hard to see anything, but he saw the roars. This was near the [[Velaki]] - saw it over the lake, a dark shape with leathery wings.

## Hi [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]

She was afraid we'd find out about [[The Wizard]]. She seems annoyed that we're asking about him - seems her father, the [[Kolyana Indirovich|Burgomaster]] was lead astray by [[The Wizard]].

We try and see if [[Marko Romenzo|Marko]] is a useful ally. He does know the road to [[Velaki]] so maybe?

Where does [[Madam Eva]] get her powers? [[Strahd]]? Who knows.

## Borrowing Some Things from [[Tser Pool]] Camp

[[Artemis Lee|Artemis]] is dead against this 'borrowing'.
