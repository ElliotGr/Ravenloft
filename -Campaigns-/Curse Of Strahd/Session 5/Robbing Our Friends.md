![[Tser Pool.bmp]]

 We're starting from the South side. The noise is a little quieter now - the [[Vestani]] are day drinkers so it's time for the chill evening sesh.

## Talking Team

Everyone is chatting quietly - DMCs.

### [[Martel]]

[[Martel]] starts chatting with the horses - Timmy, James, Sylvester, Jimmy. Manages to get a horse convoy going which everyone notices. He summons his flame spirit and use it to teleport. ROLL INITIATIVE!!!

### [[Marko Romenzo|Marko]]

Starts talking to [[Christina]]. She won't stop him taking a wagon to save [[Lukas]], but she won't help him.

### [[Rolo]]

He's there too.

## Sneaking Team

[[Gh'yia Mx-haye-sxonne|Guy]] spills his business trying to sneak up a hill. The business is found by a guard. The business seems the MBA equivalent to lorem ipsum text.

Becomes one with the mud.
