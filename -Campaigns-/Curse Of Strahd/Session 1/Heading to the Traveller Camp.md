We're lead by [[Alwyn]] and [[Martel]] toward the [[Traveller Camp]]. Just off the camp we see a smouldering fire. Remnants of apple cores etc. Propped up against a tuft of grass is a letter.

It looks like the area was probably left around 1:23 minutes ago, maybe around 3 or so people or animals etc. 3 sets of footprints leading away, but difficult to tell exactly. Some wheel tracks on the path, they had a wagon.

60ft visibility due to the fog.

> Travellers, thank you for accepting my invitation to [[Barovia]]. My master will be most appreciative. I need to look for more fellow heroes to assist our world. If you continue along this road for 5 hours, along the road, he will meet us now. Otherwise meet some of the [[Vestani]] who he is a member of.

We try to decide whether or not to leave now.

> It's quiet, too quiet

We head down the hill to the West. We cast light on some stones, which honestly makes our visibility worse lmao.
