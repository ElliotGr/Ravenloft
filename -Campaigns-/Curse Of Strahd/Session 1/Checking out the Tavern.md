En route to the [[Blood of the Vine Tavern]], we see [[BIldrath's Mercantile]].

The tavern seems empty, despite hearing voices from outside. 3 people in bright clothes ([[Vestani]]) by the entrance. Barkeep moves around somewhat robotically, obviously in his routine. 1 man in the corner.

## Talking to the [[Vestani]]

[[Vestani]] initially look surprised then have a look of understanding. We approach them. They look at us. We present the first letter from [[Arrigal]]. They say he's a good man and he travels frequently. There's something more to what's going on that they're keeping from us. There's some insider knowledge we're not being imparted with.

They tell us to find [[Madam Eva]]. They're kinda assholes.

> Another batch of newcomers

> [[Strahd]] is gonna be eating well

> [[Arrigal]], what's that fool doing? He must be in debt.

## Team Huddle

We don't trust [[Vestani]].

## Talking to the Man in the Corner

He's been checking us out. [[Ismark Kolyana]] seems to be minding his own business.

[[Gh'yia Mx-haye-sxonne|Guy]] goes to talk to [[Ismark Kolyana]]. We all follow after a brief bit of flirting. We're not the first ones to be invited. It's [[Strahd]]'s handwriting in the letter.

He's the [[Kolyana Indirovich|Burgomaster]]'s son. We are safe in this residence (for the moment at least). [[Strahd]] has lured us into his realm. No escape from his realm. [[Strahd]] has corrupted what was once a beautiful civilisation.

The mists will get us if we try to leave - poisonous AF. You suffer a terrible fate when you try to leave.

[[Strahd]] has spies everywhere, creature of the night. Equipped with dark magic et al. Be careful.

[[Strahd]] once had a crush on some lass. Those who die in Barovia stay in the land as ghosts. Some people are born without souls - empty husks of automation, such as [[Arrick]]. Much of the village is made of people like this. These people are victims of [[Strahd]]'s malice and misery. [[Strahd]] thinks [[Ireena Kolyana]] is his reincarnated love from ages past.

The letter we got said she'd been bitten, [[Ireena Kolyana]], that is. There is no well, there is no Timmy down it.

The [[Vestani]] aren't exactly loyal to [[Strahd]].

We'd need some prep before we head to the castle. Best to travel and explore the lands. Secrets around the place to be uncovered.

[[Ismark Kolyana]] wants a favour. He wants to hide [[Ireena Kolyana]] somewhere safe.
