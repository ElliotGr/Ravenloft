Around 100ft from the gates, observing them. We see a [[Random Raven]] which [[Martel]] tries to communicate with. It stares at us. It tells us to proceed through the gate. We ask if it wants to come with us? It takes a berry from [[Martel]] then flies to the toe of the statue.

We have an ominous feeling of being watched. Those are some big 'ole statues.

I approach the gate and step on a hidden pressure plate. There's a loud screeching noise and the gate is opening slowly.

We look through the gate. As we pass through the threshold it looks very similar. Nothing jumps out at us. No jump scares. The gate moves as if by magic.
