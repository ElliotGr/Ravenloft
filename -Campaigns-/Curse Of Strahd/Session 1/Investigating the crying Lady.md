Try to knock, no response. No latch on the door, it swings open freely. Large room, unfurnished. Bare wooden floors, dresser table, moth-eaten sofa on one side.

Toss a light rock into the room. We are hesitant to break and enter (or just enter I suppose lol).

[[Martel]] turns into a mouse and scopes out the house. Finds [[Mad Mary]]. In front of her knees she's clutching a doll. Small sack in the corner. Bare room again, no lights, no candles.

[[Rolando|Rolo]] tries to contact [[Mad Mary]] via message spell. Ask her if she needs any help. She doesn't like us talking in her head.

Passers-by look at us with sympathy, disgust and pity. Hard to tell whether they don't react to the crying because they've gotten used to it or because they can't hear it.

[[Alwyn]] tries to ask [[Random Barovian Gentleman]]. He says it's [[Mad Mary]]'s house. She's been crying for several days. He doesn't know the way out. He says some people try to leave but it doesn't work. We don't know anything.

He's spoken to a lot of travellers. We're all the same, we all meet the same demise. [[Blood of the Vine Tavern]] is the safest place. Mentions [[Strahd]].

We reach the top of the stairs

## Talking to [[Mad Mary]]

[[Rolo]], [[Martel]] and [[Elliot Gravestock|Me]] go to chat to her. I ask about the doll.

> [!caution]+ Asking about the Doll
> Annie. She turns the doll to look at me. [[Gertrude]] loved the doll.

Her daughter she's missing. Hasn't seen her in a week. She's 15. [[Gertrude]]. Very proud of her. Used to take her doll everywhere.

She knows there are people out there watching us. Gestures out the window to the NE of the town. He's watching them, [[Strahd]].

The Burgomaster is out towards the edge of the village, North.

The doll is from a [[Gadolf|Toymaker]] in [[Velaki]], way East he might know something.

She begs us not to go after [[Strahd]].
