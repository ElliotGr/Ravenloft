After we pass through the gate, we continue down a pretty similar road. This feels like a well defined path. Still a vague vibe of being watched.

[[Alwyn]] disappears into the fog, and seems to disappear. [[Rolando|Rolo]] uses shape water to give us a little bit more visibility.

After another hour of walking we're starting to get a little bit tired. [[Artemis Lee|Artemis]] catches a smell - smell of decay and death. He takes his shield etc out.

[[Rolando|Rolo]] casts mage armour on himself. We extinguish our lights.

The smell gets stronger, can start to smell the direction. A bit further on, a little distance off the path on the right. We approach the smell closer.
