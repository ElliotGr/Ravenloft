We see a mound in the fog where the smell is coming from.

3-4 feet across, somewhat undulating.

Overwhelming smell of death, can hear flies circling it.

> [!info]+ The Mound of Death
> We step up to the mound of death a single corpse - half buried in the underbrush. Young man, indistinctive from the maggots and flies on his flesh. Started to rot. Muddy and torn clothes. Deliberately torn, slashed. Fetal position on his side.
> 
> Body has been dead for several days at this point. Cause of death is a large wound in his side. Wounds are made from a large set of claws - possibly a lycanthrope.
> 
> Looking at the corpse, it's still dressed. Large cloak over the top, obscuring his body. Simple clothes.

I go to bless the body. I feel a soft, flat indent on the cloak.

> [!abstract]+ Letter V2
> Hail thee of might and valor:
> 
> I, the Burgomaster of Barovia, send you honor—with despair.
> 
> My adopted daughter, the fair Ireena Kolyana, has been these past nights bitten by a vampyr. For over four hundred years, this creature has drained the life blood of my people. Now, my dear Ireena languishes and dies from an unholy wound caused by this vile beast. He has become too powerful to conquer.
> 
> So I say to you, give us up for dead and encircle this land with the symbols of good. Let holy men call upon their power that the devil may be contained within the walls of weeping Barovia. Leave our sorrows to our graves, and save the world from this evil fate of ours.
> 
> There is much wealth entrapped in this community. Return for your reward after we are all departed for a better life.
> 
> Kolyan Indirovich Burgomaster

As we're reading the letter we hear a howl, accompanied by a second howl comes from near the gates. I try to give a funeral rites and light some incense before heading onward.

The werewolf howl is the first sound we've heard in a while. The wolf sounds start to fade.
