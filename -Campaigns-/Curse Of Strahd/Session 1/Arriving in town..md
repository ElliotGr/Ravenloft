We can hear a lone, sobbing woman. I head toward the sound of the woman. We approach a main street. We don't see anyone. Very empty. We can hear where the woman's crying is coming from. 300ft ahead, to the left. Around WSW.

## Heading toward [[Random Barovian Lady]]

As we go forward, we start to see occasional people. Very heavily clad in long cloaks, hoods pulled up.

The woman is in a mighty rush and doesn't really answer any of our questions.

## [[Tall Male Figure]] Walks by

Strange fellow, vacant expression. Going the opposite direction to the [[Random Barovian Lady]].

## Investigating the Crying

Occasional crying. Comes and goes. We enter a town square/market area. Still paved but completely barren. Can see lights coming from some of the abodes. Can hear faint chatter from a building next to us. We see the [[Blood of the Vine Tavern]]. People give us looks of confusion and distain and deep sadness. They don't have the capacity to be interested in us.

We pinpoint the [[Crying Lady House]].
