## Initiative Start

### Alwyn

Keeps just stealing things lmao.

### Dukane

Denzo is nearly dead lmao.

### Rolo

He gained some fangs?

> You may get away but you'll be marked forever as an enemy of this land!

### Ireena

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] === [[Madam Eva]]

### Phase 2

[[Madam Eva]] comes out to fuck us up.

She just banishes [[Marko Romenzo|Marko]] (socially, not the spell).

We're now an enemy of *all* the [[Vestani]].

[[Madam Eva]] zaps [[Marko Romenzo|Marko]] after turning gaseous. Feels joined with her then alone again. Weird and eerie. We'll get to that next time.

## Loot Time!

### Bag 1

Nat 20!

Then roll a 47 on d100 loot table.

> [!Success] Item
> Glowing red gem. Unnatural iridescent light. Who the fuck knows?
