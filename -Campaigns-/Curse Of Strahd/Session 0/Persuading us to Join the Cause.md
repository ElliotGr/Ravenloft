[[Gh'yia Mx-haye-sxonne|Guy]] hasn't signed anything yet. [[Arrigal]] needs help. I join from helping the landlady with some barrels. 

There's some lady who has a great affliction and needs saving.

> Hail to thee of might and valor.
> 
> I, a lowly servant of Barovia, send honor to thee. We plead for thy so desperately needed assistance.
> 
> The love of my life, Ireena Kolyana, has been afflicted by an evil so deadly that even the good people of our village cannot protect her. She languishes from her wound, and I would have her saved from this menace.
> 
> There is much wealth in this community. I offer all that might be had to thee and thy fellows if thou shalt but answer my desperate plea.
> 
> Come quickly, for her time is at hand! All that I have shall be thine!
