The [[Village of Barovia]] is under constant attack from various creatures of the night. No attacks since [[Kolyana Indirovich]] died.

I know that vampire and bats are linked. The vampiric disease came from bats.

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] enters. WE GET BREAKFAST!!! There's stew.

[[Ismark Kolyana|Ismark]] doesn't actually know that much about the artefacts. Relics, that's the word.

The [[Vestani]] probably know more.

We can't do much without [[Strahd]] noticing. If they try to organise a resistance, he interferes.

A way to weaken [[Strahd]] could be to bring hope to people? Caution - people have been living like this for years, we would have to do a lot to change it. But rescuing [[Gertrude]] isn't going to do much by itself.

[[Strahd]] wants [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]].

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] has a favour. [[Kolyana Indirovich]] is still in the house. He hasn't had a proper burial yet. The people in the village don't like [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], so they haven't helped her bury it.
