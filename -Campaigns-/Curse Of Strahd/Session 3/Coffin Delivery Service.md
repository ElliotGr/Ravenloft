We carry the coffin between us all. It's brighter than before. We attract a lot of attention from the locals. Pass the [[Ravenloft/Barovia/Town of Barovia/Blood of the Vine Tavern/Blood of the Vine Tavern|Blood of the Vine Tavern]]. Pass through the town square where we fought last time.

I give [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] vigilant blessing. [[Mad Mary]] is quiet at the moment.

We enter the [[Church]]. We see a figure in the chapel - [[Donovich|Father Donovich]]. He's fervently praying to the [[Church of the Morning Lord|Morning Lord]]. Prostrated. [[Martel]] goes to talk to him. He raises his voice. A high-pitched shout of people who are in distress.

[[Donovich]] says it's been years since someone has been here. That can't be true, says [[Ismark Kolyana|Ismark]]. He was there but 3 months ago.

Someone is really hungry out there. [[Doru]].

We place the coffin down.

[[Dukane]] finally gets an invite and comes in.

## Interrogating [[Donovich]]

Cold air as it rushed in. Engulfing his precious warmth of the morning sun. Remembers the sounds of his son greeting him. He wasn't himself. A day, a week, a month ago. 8 days ago? Similar to [[Gertrude]].

We shall save him. Over there? Gestures to one of the rooms lining the corridor.

## Finding the Voice

It's coming from underneath us? [[Rolando|Rolo]] pulls a book out of the rubble - 'blade of truth, the war against diabolist inquisition fought by the …??'. Dense tome. Chunky.

I check the altar for a hidden passage etc. Nothing, but I did roll a 5 so…

His son is in the trapdoor? He's touched by darkness, by evil. He's not a regular sort of hungry, he's [[Dukane]]'s sort of hungry.

## How long Does a Burial Take?

15 mins or so? But has to be during the dawn times.

## What Happened to the Son

A terrible fate has befallen him.

We agree that in 7 days we either try our best to save him or kill him in the process.

## Planning the Day

4 hour round trip to [[Tser Pool]].

We're gonna go to the [[BIldrath's Mercantile]].
