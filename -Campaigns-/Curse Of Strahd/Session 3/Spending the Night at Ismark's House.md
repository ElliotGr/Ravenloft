As we look back at the corpses of the zombies, they seem to evaporate into a puff of smoke.

[[Ismark Kolyana|Ismark]] should have known better than to be out after dark - according to him.

We approach the [[Burgomaster House]]. [[Ismark Kolyana|Ismark]] collapses on the doorstep. [[Gh'yia Mx-haye-sxonne|Guy]] picks him up and takes him inside.

The door is locked and we can't get in. We take a long time to figure out that we need to knock.

[[Ireena Kolyana]] opens the door, gives us all stern looks. Leads us into the house. [[Dukane]] closes the door behind us. The door is barricaded closed as we enter.

We enter the [[Burgomaster House#Side Room]]. I head to get her medicine kit. We start to try and keep [[Ismark Kolyana|Ismark]] alive. I bless him and we use lesser restoration on him. Use a bottle of clear liquid on a bandage. (Holy water?). This seems to help him heal. Washes and dresses the wound.

On a detect poison and disease - it's a necrotic disease - the rot.

[[Ireena Kolyana]] says we're fools. They haven't had hope for quite some time now. She gives a dirty look to [[Dukane]].

We have a bit of a row and decide to get some sleep. [[Ismark Kolyana|Ismark]] wakes up again and [[Ireena Kolyana]] goes off at him.

Beyblades are canon - [[Dukane]] played it as a child.

We get a decent amount of sleep. [[Dukane]] hangs from the ceiling like a bat.

## My Period of Watch

Difficult to see out due to how light it is inside the room. I hear a very very high pitched squeak. Lots of different pitches. Intermittent, constant. So high that it must be bats.
