`$= await dv.view('一Resources一/Views/sceneHeader')`

Lots of different people here, around 12 people. Colourful dress - [[Vestani]]. Having fun.

When they see us, they're a bit more nervous.

The lead can take us to [[Madam Eva]]

## [[Madam Eva]]

Toggle the table of contents

[[Lukas]] has been corrupted by [[Strahd]]. Maybe in [[Castle Ravenloft]]. She brings out a pack of cards.

Her eyes go white. I do detect magic just for fun:

- Cards are illusion
- Madam Eva's axe is conjuration
- Madam Eva herself is illusion

### [[Alwyn]]

Undead crave bedtime stores - recite the 'zombie and the sunflower'.

## The Tent Blows up Lmao

Something fires out of the tent. The cards disintegrate. Dispel magic. Madam Eva has grown to ~6 foot tall. Muscular. Young man with long, flowing black hair. Big explosion of fire.

## Talking to Actual [[Madam Eva]]

Seems warmer than it should be. See the real [[Madam Eva]]. Has a deck of cards and a glowing crystal ball.
