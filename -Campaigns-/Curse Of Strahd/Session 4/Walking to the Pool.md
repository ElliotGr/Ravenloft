En route to [[Tser Pool]], going West of [[Village of Barovia]].

Crossroads:

 - North - [[Tser Pool]]
 - East - [[Village of Barovia]]
 - South - [[Tser Falls]]

We see a spooky gallows.

[[Gh'yia Mx-haye-sxonne|Guy]] sees himself hanging from the noose.

Touches the copy-self. Convulses in agony. Fizzles apart as if made of sand. Falls apart. Nearly falls into a spike pit. Manages not to fall.

## Head north

Forest here. Path goes into overhanging trees. Semi-darkness. Cold here. Lots animals here. Treeline ends behind us. Opens up into clearing. It's the [[Tser Pool]]. Noisy, laughter, music.
