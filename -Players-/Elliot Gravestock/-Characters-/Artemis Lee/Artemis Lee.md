![[Artemis.png]]

> [!info]- Voice
> Texan drawl, low, *not comedic*.

> [!abstract]- Appearance
> Wearing a thick leather overcoat over a white shirt with a ruffled collar. He has tough leather boots. Under his clothes he has a full set of chain mail, making him more protected than he seems.
> 
> Around his neck hangs a symbol of [[Church of Selûne|Selûne]]. He has a shield emblazoned with the same symbol hanging from his pack.

> [!question]- Why did he start to follow [[Church of Selûne|Selûne]]
> When he was young, he got lost in a wood on a dark night. He wandered for hours in the pitch darkness, fearing for his life. When he was losing hope, the clouds lifted and the moon shone brightly, providing him light and hope in his darkest moment.
> 
> From that moment on, he dedicated himself to [[Church of Selûne|Selûne]], feeling that event was a divine calling.

> [!question]- The rest of his life
> On reaching eligibility, he joined a temple of [[Church of Selûne|Selûne]] to better serve her. He spent many years there, learning how best to serve her and how to shine her light on others. He was gifted with divine abilities and after a spell, he decided he could better serve [[Church of Selûne|Selûne]] by leaving the temple and go amongst the people.
> 
> He spent the next several years wandering from town to town, trying to be a light in the darkness for as many people as he could find. He provided clerical aid, both magical and mundane to anyone he met freely, without reservation as a cleric of [[Church of Selûne|Selûne]] is expected to.

> [!question]- Why did he end up in [[Barovia]]
> He felt a pull one day, as if [[Church of Selûne|Selûne]] was calling him to a new task she had for him.

> [!danger]- Fear
> Has an intense fear of the dark, to the extent that for an extended period during his time at the monastery, he became nocturnal, both to be closer to [[Church of Selûne|Selûne]], but also to allow him to sleep during the day.
> 
> This obviously comes from his experience in the forest as a child, as he wasn't afraid of the dark before then. He uses his faith and connection to his god to help him through his fears.

> [!example]- Overview
> Artemis Lee is a male, human twilight cleric of Selûne. He's 34 years old with a gruff, rugged exterior from his years travelling as a wandering priest. His hair is short, clearly cut clumsily with a knife and he has a dusting of stubble over his face. While traveling he typically wears a set of chainmail underneath a set of sturdy traveling clothes which include a white ruffled tunic, a pair of sturdy leather boots and dark trousers. Over it all he wears a dark overcoat with delicate silver thread woven in to form the appearance of the night's sky. He carries a pack with him which his weapons are lashed to when he isn't wielding them: a warhammer in the shape of a crescent moon alongside a shield emblazoned with Selûne's symbol. The same symbol, a pair of eyes surrounded by seven stars, is hung around his neck, crafted of delicate silver and moonstone.
> 
> Artemis grew up on a farm and would frequently wander the hills and forests around his home. One fateful eve, he got hopelessly lost, wandering for hours in the pitch blackness. As he heard the sounds of various creatures circling him, closing in, the clouds parted and the the light of Selûne shone down on him, unnaturally bright, lighting a path to safety. While the experience left him deeply scared of the dark, he took it as a sign and dedicated his life to the Moonmaiden, spending several years at one of her temples before leaving to travel the lands, spreading her light to all who might need it.
