This fucker is a dhampir ffs.

Comes from the mountains, heard there were adventurers in the land. Heard this from 3 [[Vestani]] heading out West. That's where he heard of us. The travellers had mentioned a threat to [[Strahd]].

Had heard there were some strangers summoned to the lands. Slight grimace as he looks at the blood on [[Martel]]'s face. Was hoping for something a bit better than us.

He's pretty anti [[Strahd]].

He's spent his whole life resisting his hungers (for blood). He didn't choose the vampire life, the vampire life chose him. [[Draken]] was his sire. The [[Vestani]] injured [[Draken]]. He killed [[Draken]] in his bloodlust from when he killed the [[Vestani]].
