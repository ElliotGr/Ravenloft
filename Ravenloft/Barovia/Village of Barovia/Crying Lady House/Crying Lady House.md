`$= await dv.view('一Resources一/Views/locationHeader')`

No lights on. Crying from [[Mad Mary]] coming from inside. Can see deep claw-marks on the wood, windows etc. Some similar to the body from [[Approaching the Mound]], some longer, some shorter, some deeper, some shallower. Generally look like they're made from claws.

Large room, unfurnished. Bare wooden floors, dresser table, moth-eaten sofa on one side. Barren room. Claw marks on the inside of the room.

There's scratches in the floorboards saying "sorrow", "Gertrude" etc…
