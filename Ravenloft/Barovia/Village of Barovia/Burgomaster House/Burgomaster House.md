Where [[Kolyana Indirovich|Burgomaster]] lives, who wrote the letters we found on the body and on [[Arrigal]].

On the South side of the village.

## Front Lawn

Weary mansion behind a cast iron gate, rusted. Squeaking in the breeze. Weedy grounds. Next to the wall around the house, there's a trampled path.

Weeds are torn and trampled around the edges. Slightly worn footprints of large wolves and skeletal bare human footprints.

Stone steps by entryway.

## Entrance

To the right of the door is a long wooden box - coffin?

## Hallway

Lots of doors.

## Side Room

Well furnished, but moth-eaten. Layer of dust and mold. Sofa in there. Large living space, paintings in gold frames.

Painting of a stern older man with hard features, fine clothing - [[Kolyana Indirovich]].

## Kitchen

Noice Kitchen. Functional, got a large dining table, enough for all of us.
