## Bitey

Been bitten twice by [[Strahd]]. He took a liking to her as a little girl. She doesn't remember anything about the bites. [[Strahd|He]] was very charming. Don't let him get close to you. Clever and manipulative. Lucky break she thinks? I don't think so. Most of what she said seems genuine. She doesn't seem like she knows what happened. Seems like there's more to this, but might not be able to tell us?

She seems like she *should* be a vampire. Been 25 years or so.

Also a bite on her arm.
