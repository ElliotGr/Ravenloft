`$= await dv.view('一Resources一/Views/locationHeader')`

[[Madam Eva]] is here.

West of the village, then North at crossroads. Via the [[Vestani]] camp.

Clearing with a large body of water. Lots of tents here, a bit of an encampment. Obviously the [[Vestani]].

There's lots of caravans and supplies here - these guys obviously have a lotta stuff. Seems to be a more wealthy group of [[Vestani]].

## Larger Tent

Big tent, steps, more headroom. This is where [[Madam Eva]] obviously is.

Bigger on the inside. Velvet, dark colours. Lamps. Long mahogany table with long black velvet covering on top.
