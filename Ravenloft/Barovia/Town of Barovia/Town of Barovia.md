`$= await dv.view('一Resources一/Views/locationHeader')`

Some meagre shacks, some larger dwellings. Fairly dilapidated. Dull wood, rotted. Windows are black, no lights. No sounds other than mournful sobbing.

Cobblestone streets. No location signs etc. The pavement gets flatter and more even. Very empty. No stench of death.

Main roads with a central crossroads.

Lots of dull, dark, lifeless empty houses and buildings. Shops and trading posts that have been boarded up etc. Abandoned a long time ago.
